          .copy Exercism is a great gift to the programming community and I hope when I finally achieve my Rock Star status I won’t forget to give back and do my own bit of mentoring.

        %p Exercism relies on both the generosity of individuals with their time, and the generosity of organisations to financially support us. 
        %p While much of Exercism is run by our volunteer community, the website and core infrastructure are managed by a full-time team. We also undertake specific larger projects, such as the development of our automated analyzers, which require a committed team working more intensely on something over a fixed period of time. 
        %p In order to fund this core team and these products we rely on grant funding from companies or organisation that wish to contribute to our vision of helping providing free programming education for everyone.

        %p 
          Exercism is developed through a mixture of top-down leadership and a collaberative community. We focus strongly on making product-driven decisions guided by our strategy, and then utilize the value and goodwill of our community, who implement those decisions across our 50+ language tracks. We work closely with key volunteer contributors to canvas opinions and knowledge, improving Exercism daily, while also staying focussed on our long-term vision.

        %h2 Our story
        %p Exercism was originally created by Katrina Owen in 2013 as a tool to be used by her programming students. Over the next three years it grew unintentially and organically to 200,000 users. In 2016, Katrina decided that for Exercism to fulfill its potential, it needed a professional product team to rethink Exercism from the ground up. She recruited Jeremy Walker as co-founder, and working with Nicole Chalmers and the team at Thalamus, they reconceived Exercism as the fully-fledged product you see today.
